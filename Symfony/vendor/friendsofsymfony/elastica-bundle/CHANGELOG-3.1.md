* 3.1.0 (Unreleased)

 * BC BREAK: `Doctrine\Listener#scheduleForDeletion` access changed to private.
 * BC BREAK: `ObjectPersisterInterface` gains the method `handlesObject` that
   returns a boolean value if it will handle a given object or not.
 * BC BREAK: Removed `Doctrine\Listener#getSubscribedEvents`. The container
   configuration now configures tags with the methods to call to avoid loading
   this class on every request where doctrine is active. #729
 * Added ability to configure `date_detection`, `numeric_detection` and
   `dynamic_date_formats` for types. #753
 * New event `POST_TRANSFORM` which allows developers to add custom properties to
   Elastica Documents for indexing.
 * When available, the `fos:elastica:populate` command will now use the 
   ProgressBar helper instead of outputting strings. You can use verbosity
   controls on the command to output additional information like memory 
   usage, runtime and estimated time.
